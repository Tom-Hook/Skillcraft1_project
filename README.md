# Skillcraft1_project

In our Python for Data Analysis course we have for project to study the Skillcraft1 dataset and establish the best possible predictive model. We were able to apply everything we learned during the semester and went deeper into certain subjects on our own with the help of the internet. It was an enjoyable and interesting job, despite the fact that we feel that we have not been able to make predictions that meet our expectations. The dataset does not seem easy to grasp for a Machine Learning model.
You can find everything you need on this directory, such as our notebook, the Flask API link and the powerpoint.
